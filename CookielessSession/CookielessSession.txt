By Default session uses cookies
	Session Id is stored as cookie on the client computer.This session id, is then, used by webserver to identify
	if the request is coming from the same user or different user.

Some of the users,don't like websites writing  information  to their computers.So it is very common for users to disable 
cookies.If that is the case,then websites using cookies ,to manage the session may not work as expected.
However,to overcome this problem cookieless session can be enabled To enable cookieless sessions,set cookieless="true"
in webconfig.

Http is a stateless protocol.To identify if request is coming from same server or from different to webserver.
it generate an unique sessionid

google chrome->inspect element->Resources->cookies->localhost->ASP.net session id is there

to disable cookies
setting -> search cookies->content cookies->check radio btn 'Block sites from setting any data'

for cookieless session 
configure <sessionState mode="InProc" timeout="20" cookieless="true"></sessionState> in web.config 
http://localhost:65059/(S(clhlidwffuraj0ta4rqc2gdy))/WebForm1.aspx


When cookieless sessions are enabled,the session id's  part of the URL and is sent back  and forth between the client  and the webserver
with every request and response.

the webserver ,uses  the session id from the URL ,to identify  if the request  has come from  the same user or differnet user

To cookieless sessions to work correctly ,relative URL's must be used in the application when redirecting users to different webform 
eg. Response.Redirect("~/WebForm2.aspx") Relative URL

Response.Redirect("http://localhost:65059/WebForm1.aspx")  //absolute URL
