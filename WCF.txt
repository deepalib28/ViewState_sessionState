WCF -Windows COmmunication foundation is  microsoft platform  for building  distributed and interoperable applications.

Distrributed  applicatiuon -application  where parts of it run on 2  or more  computer nodes.also called as connected systems.

ex. web application  running  on one machine  and web  service that this application is consuming  is running on another 
machine

web application server<---->webservice server
   
-----------------------------------------

To improve scalability -No of user incearse don't want to decrade the performance
eg.an  enterprise  web application may have  following tiers and each tier may be running on a different machine 


Server with Presentation tier<--->Server with business tier<--->Server with data access tier
more capabiltiy
their own process and memory 

Why build distributed application
1.An enterprise application may need to use  the services provided by other enterprises
	eg. enterprice application may want to use paypal  serviuce for payments

2.scalability

----------------------------
	What is interoperable  application 
	An application that can be communicated with any other application that is built on any other platform.

	-Web services are interoperable ,where as .NET remoting services are not.Web services can communicate with any application 
	built on any platform whereas .NET remoting service can consumed only by another .net application.
	--------------------------
	what technology	choices did we have before WCF to build distributed application?
	1.Enterprise service
	2.dot net Remoting 
	3.Web service

	----------------------------
	why should we use 
	We haeve 2 clients and we need to implement a service for them 
	
	The first client is using Java application to interact with our service,so far interoperability  
	this client  wants messages to be in  XML format and the protocol to be HTTP

	Without WCF,to satify first client  requirment we end up implementing  an asmx  web service.


								Client built on any platform 
								can consume  a web service

								HTTP Protocol
	Java Web Application	<----------------------------------------------->Dot Net webservice
								   XML Message Format
							XML  over HTTP offers  interoperability

	Second client uses.net so far for better  performance this client  wants messages formatted in binary  over TCP protocol.


								With remoting  both client and 
								server must be in .net	
								
								  TCP Protocol
	Client window Application<--------------------------------------------------->Dot net remoting service 
									Binary message format 
									Binary over TCP offers better performance


-----
To Unify  and bring all these communication technology under one roof microsoft come up with a single programming  model
that is WCF.

-------------------
With WCF
we implement  one service and we can configure as many endpoints as want to support all the client needs.to support the 
above 2 client requiremnt we would configur 2 endpoints.In the endpoint configuration we can specify the protocols 
and message  format taht we want  to use.



								Http Protocol
Java web appplication	<---------------------------------------------------------------------->|Enddpoint 1
									XML  Message format															|
