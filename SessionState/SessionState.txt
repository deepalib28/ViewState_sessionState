Just like query string,Session state variables can also be used to send data from one  webform to another.

Points to remember
1.Session state variables are stored on the webserver by default,and are kept for the lifetime of a session.
we can set timeout property for session 
need to do specify session time out propersty otherwise there is problem of out of memory.
default time out of inproc is 20 mins

2. default mode is inproc.

3. single user global data(seesion state variables are available across all the pages,but only for single session.)
4. It is always a good practice to check null, if session state vaiable is null before calling any methods such as toString() otherwise there is 
	a null reference exception.

5. Disable session state for particular page 
<%@ Page Language="C#" EnableSessionState="false" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="WebForm1.aspx.cs" Inherits="SessionState.WebForm1" %>
6.  In web.config  application level
  <sessionState mode="Off" timeout="20"></sessionState>

 disabling session if not using improve performance
