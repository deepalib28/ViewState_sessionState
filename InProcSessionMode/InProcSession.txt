Asp.net session state mode is set in webconfig.
1. Off
2.Inproc
3.StateServer
4.SqlServer
5.Custom want to store on own system like oracle

Inside process -in proc 
outside process-stateserver ,sql server

When the session state mode is set to  Inproc,the session state variable are stored on the web server memory inside the asp.net
worker process .This is default session state mode 

to see worker process open task manager->clik on show all processses->w3wp.exe(IIS worker process)
In proc
<sessionState mode="Inproc" timeout="20"></sessionState>

Note :
Web Garden: Web application deployed  on a server with multiple  processors.
Web Farm: Web application  deployed  on multiple server

Advantage of  InProc 
1. Very esay to implement.All that is required is ,to sest ,the session state mode= inproc in web.config file.
2. will perform best  because  the session state  memory is kept  on the webserver,within the asp.net worker process(w3wp.exe)
   easy to read write .always better to read from memory and not from harddisk.
3. suited for web application hosted on a single server.
4.Object can be  added   without serialization.

DisAdvantage 
1. Session state  data is lost,when the worker process or application pool is recycled.
2.Not suitable  for webfarms and webgarden

WebFarm  not used in In Proc 
same app on each server
Webserver<-------------------
							|
							|
webserver<------------->Load balancer  <---------------------- >Client
							|

webserver<------------------|

request comes to least busy server store session worker process.no session will be found if request goes to 2nd web server.

3.Scalability could be an issue.(1000 of user memory run out of space,paging)
