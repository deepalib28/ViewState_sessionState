When the session state server mode is set to State server,the session  state variables  are stored in a process,called 
as asp.net	state service.	

The asp.net state service can be present  on a webserver or a dedicated  machine.
start service
 <sessionState mode="StateServer" stateConnectionString="tcpip=localhost:42424" timeout="20" ></sessionState>

 Advantage
 1.ASP.Net worker process independent,survives when worker process restarts
 2.Can be used as Webfarms and web gardens

 3. provide more scalabilitythan In proc


 Disadvantage
 1.Slower than InProc
 2.Complex objects need tto serializs and deserialized
 3.If the state server is on a dedicated  machine  and if the server goes down  allthe sessions are lost.
